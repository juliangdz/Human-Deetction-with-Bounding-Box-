# Human-Deetction-with-Bounding-Box-
Human Detection using Pytorch


I have Used the Pytorch with YOLO repository from https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3 to generate the Boinding bOx around the Human.

>>>>>>>>>>>Requirements:

1. OpenCV Python
2. yoloV3 weights from the wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
3. if anaconda is installed on the system good for research solving as the anaconda package gives the researcher with all the required computational tools and libraries.
4. GPU like Nvidia is prefered for usage to speed the process. In this project however i have not used a GPU enabled system, so all the compuations are all done on the CPU.
4. install Pytorch and torchvison as these are the Deep Learning libraries for Python. Research oriented problem solving usually prefers Pytorch over TensorFlow.
